# City Explorer

**Author**: Natalija
**Version**: 1.0.0 (increment the patch/fix version number if you make more commits past your first submission)

## Overview

This is a city explorer application with the purpose of unforming the user of different items available in the city that they are searching for. From weather, entertainment to a map with the geographic coordinates, the user will be able to make a educated decision of where they would like to explore next based on their interests.

## Getting Started

The first steps that the developer would need is to build out a front end of their React app. this will be the information that the user will see to make the application interactive and give information to the user. Afterward, the developer would need to guild the back end server to be able to pull the proper weather data utilizing the proper API weather library.

By the time the user will have access the only need is for a city of choice to be built in.

## Architecture

The primary libraries used are React, WeatherIO, LocationIQ. The languages used are JSX, JS, React-Bootstrap, JavaScript, HTML and Python.
